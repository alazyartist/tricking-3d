        Starting with the Anatomy of a Trick. This is a way of breaking down the
        Trick into more manageable chunks that contain useful information about
        the movement. Having a way to label each of these sections allows for a
        deeper understanding of how Tricks are made up out of other elements. It
        also gives a structured way to play with new ideas by rearranging or
        variating their parts.
