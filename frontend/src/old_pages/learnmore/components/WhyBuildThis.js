				Tricking is so much more than the movements, but it is through its
				movements that we discover that moreness. The rich world of exploration
				only comes after a basic understanding is grasped. The goal of this
				project is to bridge that gap. To create something that will speed up
				the realization of what is available to be played with to the newcomer.
				To create a set of tools that will take anyone on this journey and
				encourage it to develop faster and in the way that that individual sees
				fit.{" "}
			</p>
			<p className='indent-4 text-base font-light'>
				One of the biggest benefits I personally see Tricking delivering is that
				it opens us up to have conversations with ourselves about our goals,
				desires, and the obstacles in our way. When we do this it allows us to
				realize what we really want and go after that, learning to overcome the
				obstacles in our ways. That understanding is something that extends well
				beyond flips. So if we can get more people Tricking, and maybe coming to
				that understanding, those people will go on to do great things for all
				of us. The rising tide lifts all ships. So let us be that tide.
