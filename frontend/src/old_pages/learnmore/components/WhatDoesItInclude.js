					The goal is to create an application that can showcase Tricking
					movements in a way that can be easily pulled up and its associated
					information had at a glance. Each Trick will have information about
					its various Parts, Takeoff, Landing, What Trick Progression it is
					within, Prerequisites, and interactive 3D examples. Users should be
					able to have discussions around these Tricks and Concepts. Saving the
					ones most relevant to their current exploration of Tricking.

					beyond what is commonly used.

					A different take on the social media experience. Instead of being able
					to add just anyone to your friends list. I think it would benefit us
					to encourage the in-person connection to be had first. So in order to
					capture another user you would need fo physically scan their code.
					This would mean we are only interacting with people we actually know
					in some way or other. Not complete strangers. I believe this will
					encourage more cordiality in discussion rather than the disrespect we
					commonly see on the internet. This would work by having a QR style
					code on the userâ€™s device that other Users can scan to capture them.
					This encourages travel and interacting in person to grow your network,
					not mass clicking add friend because this person knows 5 people you
					do.
