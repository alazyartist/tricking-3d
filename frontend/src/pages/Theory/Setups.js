				Setups are movements we perform in order to generate momentum and get
				into the starting position for a particular trick. We have generally
				been referring to pure setups as opposed to setup tricks or setup
				combos. However colloquially you will hear the term setup used to refer
				to all three. Pure setups are the initial movements used to generate
				momentum and get into the starting position for the first Trick
				performed. <br />
				<br />
				These are the movements we use to get us from a standing unmoving
				position into one that is generating movement and momentum to be used in
				the upcoming Trick. The pure setups generally include J-Step, K-Step,
				Euro-Step, Pivot, back-step, Spin Step, Skip Step, as well as Standing.
				Each of these is used to position the body in a different way depending
				on which Trick you want to perform. Many of these are just slight
				variations of simmilar ways into the same Tricks. Typically only having
				slight alterations made between them it us up to the Tricker which ones
				feel the best for a particular Trick. <br />
				<br />
				J-step, Euro-step, and Pivot for example are all ways to get into
				position where it is easy to perform a backswing. Standing, Skip-Step
				and Spin Step are common ways to get into position for a Bkick or Aerial
				style trick. This doesn't mean that someone couldn't do something like a
				spin-step into a backswing trick. They most certainly could. <br />
				<br /> Any setup can be used to get into any trick you'd like, although
				its arguable that some are better suited for particular Tricks than
				others. That's the joy of Tricking though, you get to make it your own
				through the way you approach things. So whichever setups you'd like to
				incorporate. Have at it! It can be extremely fun to put tricks together
				with setups that are unconventional, it also helps us build an
				understanding of how momentum flows through the body during movements,
				making some tricks easier and others more difficult to perform based on
				the setup we chose. Finding the right setup to use is one that will only
				come through exploration of each of these, as well as creating your own.
				The setups we listed here are just the main few that are consistently
				used. <br />
				<br />
				So the setups are what get us into the starting position of our first
				Trick. These are meant to work to our advantage in generating momentum
				to be used in execution of the Trick itself. This can make many tricks
				possible that (at first) could not easily be done from standing. We will
				be getting to the elements of the Tricks themselves in just a moment but
				first let's talk about how we "Transition" between two Tricks.
