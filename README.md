## Project Aim

### To create an **interactive tool** that showcases the terminology of the _**Tricking**_ world in a visual format.

---

Pre-Alpha => **Alpha** _(WE ARE HERE)_ => Beta => Beta 2.0 => Release

## **Pre-Alpha**

### Creating proof of concept with initial 8 animations and text information

Utilize this MVP to find other people interested in the project to contribute to the later versions
Prove the interactive animated model is possible and useful

### **Alpha**

Updating Pre-Alpha to have a base of at least 16 animations (base 8 flips)+ (360 rotation Vatioations) with text information

Using the XSENS Link Motion Capture System We will be capturing animation data for a list of initial tricks

### **Beta** (WE ARE HERE)
