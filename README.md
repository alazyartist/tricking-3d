**Pre-Alpha** _(WE ARE HERE)_ => Alpha => Beta => Beta 2.0 => Release

---

## **Pre-Alpha**

### Creating proof of concept with initial 8 animations and text information

Utilize this MVP to find other people interested in the project to contribute to the later versions
Prove the interactive animated model is possible and useful

---

### **Alpha**

Updating Pre-Alpha to have a base of at least 16 animations (base 8 flips)+ (360 rotation Vatioations) with text information
